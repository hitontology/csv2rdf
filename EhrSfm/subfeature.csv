CP.1,Manage Clinical History,,Manage Clinical History,,EhrSfmManageClinicalHistory,EhrSfmCareProvision,Manage the patient's clinical history lists used to present summary or detailed information on patient health history.,"Patient Clinical History lists are used to present succinct ""snapshots"" of critical health information including patient history; allergy, intolerance and adverse reactions; medications; problems; strengths; immunizations; medical equipment/devices; and patient and family preferences."
CP.1.1,,Manage Patient History,Manage Patient History,,EhrSfmManagePatientHistory,EhrSfmManageClinicalHistory,"Manage medical, procedural/surgical, mental health, substance use, social and family history. This includes pertinent positive and negative histories, patient-reported or externally available patient clinical history.","The history of the current illness and patient historical data related to previous medical diagnoses, surgeries and other procedures performed on the patient, clinicians involved in procedures or in past consultations, and relevant health conditions of family members is captured through such methods as patient reporting (e.g., interview, medical alert band) or electronic or non-electronic historical data. This data may take the form of a pertinent positive such as ""The patient/family member has had..."" or a pertinent negative such as ""The patient/family member has not had..."". When first seen by a health care provider, patients typically bring with them clinical information from past encounters. This and similar information may supplement locally captured documentation and notes wherever appropriate. Information regarding the patient's living situations may be an important means for a provider to uniquely identify a patient or to identify illnesses that may occur within a given proximity. Information regarding past or present living situations or environmental factors related to the patient or the fetal death may include a description of the father's type of occupation and occupational demographic information (such as the name and location of the employment). For example, it may be important for the clinician to know that the patient works in an occupation where lead exposure is common. It may also be important for the clinician to know that the patient lives in a household where asbestos routinely appears on clothing."
CP.1.2,,"Manage Allergy, Intolerance and Adverse Reaction List","Manage Allergy, Intolerance and Adverse Reaction List",,EhrSfmManageAllergyIntoleranceAndAdverseReactionList,EhrSfmManageClinicalHistory,"Manage patient-specific allergy, intolerance and adverse reaction lists.","Allergens to substances, (including immunizations), are identified and the list of allergies is captured and maintained over time. Information regarding allergies may be coded or free text; coded information is preferred (where possible). In this function the term ""allergy"" is used to refer to allergies, intolerances, adverse reactions and sensitivities. All pertinent dates, including patient-reported events, are stored and the description of the patient allergy and adverse reaction is modifiable over time. The entire allergy history, including reaction, for any allergen is viewable. The list(s) includes all reactions including those that are classifiable as a true allergy, intolerance, side effect or other adverse reaction to drug, food or environmental triggers. Notations indicating whether item is patient reported, and/or provider verified are maintained. The term 'true allergy' is defined by the US National Library of Medicine as: an allergy that is caused by a series of chemical steps in the body that produce the allergic reaction. The allergy information that should be captured may vary according to scope of practice, organizational policy, and/or jurisdictional law. For example, the documentation requirements regarding an allergic reaction to a substance that is reportable may require a higher level of data capture."
CP.1.3,,Manage Medication List,Manage Medication List,,EhrSfmManageMedicationList,EhrSfmManageClinicalHistory,Create and maintain patient-specific medication lists.,"Medication lists are managed over time, whether over the course of a visit or stay, or the lifetime of a patient. The entire medication history for any medication including, over-the-counter products, alternative supplements and herbal medications, is viewable. Medication lists are not limited to provider orders/prescriptions but may also include, for example, pharmacy dispensed medications without prescription, over the counter medications and patient-reported medications, etc. All pertinent dates, including medication start, modification, and end dates are stored. Medication Lists may also include additional information such as age-specific dosage."
CP.1.4,,Manage Problem List,Manage Problem List,,EhrSfmManageProblemList,EhrSfmManageClinicalHistory,Create and maintain patient-specific problem lists.,"A problem list may include, but is not limited to chronic conditions, diagnoses, or symptoms, injury/poisoning (both intentional and unintentional), adverse effects of medical care (e.g., drugs, surgical), functional limitations, visit or stay-specific conditions, diagnoses, or symptoms. Problem lists are managed over time, whether over the course of a visit or stay or the life of a patient, allowing documentation of historical information and tracking the changing character of problem(s) and their priority. The source (e.g., the provider, the system id, or the patient) of the updates should be documented. All pertinent dates are stored, including date noted or diagnosed, dates of any changes in problem specification or prioritization, and date of resolution. This might include time stamps, where useful and appropriate. The entire problem history for any problem in the list is viewable."
CP.1.5,,Manage Health-Related Factors List,Manage Health-Related Factors List,,EhrSfmManageHealthrelatedFactorsList,EhrSfmManageClinicalHistory,Manage patient-specific health-related factors.,"A patient's strengths (positive factors) or weaknesses (negative factors) may impact a patient's care or recovery and may be recorded as part of the EHR to support the development of care plans and treatment options. Examples of health factors include family support, financial support, health insurance levels, overall health, personal health behaviors (e.g., tobacco, physical activity, sleep), body mass index, employment status/type, access to care, or education level. Note that heath factors may be included in the Problem list (CP.1.4) which may include problems or strengths (e.g., ambulatory status or addictions). An example of an active patient-specific strength is an elderly parent receiving care from an adult child during the adult child's summer break from college. A patient's care may be affected by certain positive or negative factors. For example, coverage by insurance (a positive health factor) versus unemployment (a negative health factor)."

The entire equipment, prosthetic, orthotic, and/or implantable device list is able to be rendered."
CP.1.8,,Manage Patient and Family Preferences,Manage Patient and Family Preferences,,EhrSfmManagePatientAndFamilyPreferences,EhrSfmManageClinicalHistory,Capture and maintain patient and family preferences.,"This function is focused on the capture and maintenance of facts on patient/family preferences. Patient and family preferences regarding issues such as language, religion, spiritual practices and culture may be important to the delivery of care. It is important to capture these so that they will be available to the provider at the point of care. Patient/Family preferences differ from social history and Advance Directives as follows: Social history refers primarily to elements of a patient's background that may impact on the patient's health (e.g., smoking, drinking, occupation, abuse, etc.). Advance Directives refers to requests regarding care when the patient is unable to competently make decisions about their own care (e.g., Do Not Resuscitate orders, living wills)."
CP.1.9,,Manage Adverse Events,Manage Adverse Events,,EhrSfmManageAdverseEvents,EhrSfmManageClinicalHistory,Capture and maintain adverse events.,"This function is focused on the capture and maintenance of adverse events that have occurred to the patient.

Patients may provide data for entry into the health record or be given a mechanism for entering this data directly. Patient-originated data intended for use by providers will be available for their use. Data about the patient may be appropriately provided by: 1. the patient; 2. a surrogate (parent, spouse, guardian) or 3. an informant (teacher, lawyer, case worker) 4. devices (e.g., blood pressure/sugar monitors). An electronic health record may provide the ability for direct data entry by any of these. Patient-originated data may also be captured by devices and transmitted for inclusion into the electronic health record. Data entered by any of these must be stored with source information. A provider must authenticate patient-originated data included in the patient's legal health record. A provider must be able to indicate they have verified the accuracy of patient-originated data (when appropriate and when a verification source is available) for inclusion in the patient record. Such verification does not have to occur at each individual data field and can be at a higher level of the data."
CP.3,Manage Clinical  Documentation,,Manage Clinical  Documentation,,EhrSfmManageClinicalDocumentation,EhrSfmCareProvision,"Clinical Documentation must be managed including the capture of the documentation during an encounter,  maintenance and appropriate rendering.","Clinical documentation includes all documentation that the clinician may capture during the course of an encounter with the patient or relevant to the patient.

Management of clinical documentation also includes the acknowledgement and amendments of documentation provided by other providers."
CP.3.1,,Conduct Assessments,Conduct Assessments,,EhrSfmConductAssessments,EhrSfmManageClinicalDocumentation,Create and maintain assessment information.,"During an encounter with a patient, the provider will conduct an assessment that is germane to the age, gender, developmental or functional state, medical and behavioral condition of the patient, such as growth charts, developmental profiles, and disease specific assessments. Wherever possible, this assessment should follow industry standard protocols although, for example, an assessment for an infant will have different content than one for an elderly patient. When a specific assessment template does not exist, a new, locally-defined assessment can be created, using the format and data elements of similar assessments whenever possible. (NOTE: A new assessment may not necessarily be unique, since a facility may copy an assessment from another facility.)"
CP.3.2,,Manage Patient Clinical Measurements,Manage Patient Clinical Measurements,,EhrSfmManagePatientClinicalMeasurements,EhrSfmManageClinicalDocumentation,"Capture and manage patient clinical measures, such as vital signs, as discrete patient data.","Within the context of an episode of care, patient measures such as vital signs are captured and managed as discrete data to facilitate reporting and provision of care.

CP.3.3,,Manage Clinical Documents and Notes,Manage Clinical Documents and Notes,,EhrSfmManageClinicalDocumentsAndNotes,EhrSfmManageClinicalDocumentation,"Create, addend, amend, correct, authenticate, maintain, present and close, as needed, transcribed or directly-entered clinical documentation and notes.","Clinical documents and notes may be unstructured and created in a narrative form, which may be based on a template, graphic, audio, etc. The documents may also be structured documents that result from the capture of coded data. Each of these forms of clinical documentation is important and appropriate for different users and situations. To facilitate the management and documentation on how providers are responding to incoming data on orders and results, there may also be some free text or formal record on the providers’ responsibility, and/or standard choices for disposition, such as Reviewed and Filed, Recall Patient, or Future Follow Up. The system may also provide support for documenting the clinician’s differential diagnosis process."
CP.3.4,,Manage Patient-Specific Care and Treatment Plans,Manage Patient-Specific Care and Treatment Plans,,EhrSfmManagePatientspecificCareAndTreatmentPlans,EhrSfmManageClinicalDocumentation,"Provide templates and forms for clinicians to use for care plans, guidelines and protocols during provision of care and care planning.","During the provision of care, the clinician reviews and uses templates and forms to ensure consistent quality patient care. Care plans, guidelines or protocols may contain goals or targets for the patient, specific guidance to the providers, suggested orders, and nursing interventions, among other items, including alerts. Information such as Order sets for care plans may arrive from an external institution and need to be approved locally before being inserted into the care plan. Tracking of implementation or approval dates, modifications and relevancy to specific domains or context is provided. Transfer of treatment and care plans may be implemented electronically using, for example, templates, or by printing plans to paper."
CP.3.5,,Acknowledge/Amend Other Provider Documentation,Acknowledge/Amend Other Provider Documentation,,EhrSfmAcknowledgeamendOtherProviderDocumentation,EhrSfmManageClinicalDocumentation,Review and indicate or amend other caregiver notes as permitted.,"Scan/review notes from physicians, nurses, technicians and other members of the health care team (e.g., Respiratory Therapist, Physical Therapist). Annotate for disparities, make additions/amendments and import when desired and permitted."
CP.4,,Manage Orders,Manage Orders,,EhrSfmManageOrders,EhrSfmCareProvision,"Provide the ability to manage clinical orders and results including medication, non-medication, diagnostic tests, blood products, other biologics and referrals, using order sets as appropriate.","The provision of clinical care includes the need to order from a variety of treatments using order sets as appropriate as well as reviewing the results of treatment. Orders for treatments may include medications, non-medication therapies (e.g., physical therapy, special diet, immunizations, non-allopathic regimens); diagnostic care (e.g., laboratory , radiology); blood products and other biologics (e.g., blood transfusions, human growth hormones). Patients are often referred to other health care providers for more specialized diagnostic workup, and/or treatment. An effective EHR-S must include support and management of these processes and associated documentation."
CP.4.1,,Use Order Sets,Use Order Sets,,EhrSfmUseOrderSets,EhrSfmManageOrders,"Use Order Set templates to facilitate order entry by rendering the appropriate orders based on provider request, input or system configuration.","Predefined order set templates may include medication and non-medication orders (e.g., diet, activities, nursing care, prescriptions and requests for investigations). They allow a care provider to choose common orders for a particular circumstance or disease state according to standards or other criteria such as provider preference. Recommended order set templates may be presented based on patient data or other contexts. Order Set templates may also allow the provider to modify add/remove/change) orders during order entry for a particular patient."

Provide information regarding compliance of medication orders with formularies. Provide drug utilization review functionality including alerts regarding drug interactions and allergies.,"Medications include prescribed and over the counter (OTC) drugs, allergy shots, oxygen, anesthetics, chemotherapy, and dietary supplements that were ordered, supplied, administered, or continued. Different medication orders, including new, discontinue, refill/continue, and renew require different levels and kinds of detail, as do medication orders placed in different situations. Administration
or patient instructions are available for selection by the ordering clinician, or the ordering clinician is facilitated in creating such instructions. The system may allow for the creation of common content for prescription details. Appropriate time stamps for all medication related activity are generated. This includes series of orders that are part of a therapeutic regimen, e.g., Renal Dialysis, Oncology. When it comes to capturing the medication rationale, it is not mandatory that the provider always provide this information. In addition, the system should present the clinician with clinical decision support functionality (such as the presentation of allergies, drugdrug interactions) during the medication ordering process. When a clinician places an order for a medication, that order may or may not comply with a formulary specific to the patient’s location or insurance coverage, if applicable. Whether the order complies with the formulary should be communicated to the ordering clinician at an appropriate point to allow the ordering clinician to decide whether to continue with the order. Formulary-compliant alternatives to the medication being ordered may also be presented."

The patient is uniquely identified, after which the record is tied to that patient. Combining information on the same patient, or separating information where it was inadvertently captured for the wrong patient, helps maintain health information for a single patient. In the process of creating a patient record, it is at times advantageous to replicate identical information across multiple records, so that such data does not have to be re-entered. For example, when a parent registers children as new patients, the address, guarantor, and insurance data may be propagated in the children’s records without having to re-enter them."
CPS.1.2,,Manage Patient Demographics,Manage Patient Demographics,,EhrSfmManagePatientDemographics,EhrSfmRecordManagement,Manage patient demographic information.,"Demographic information (including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, date of birth, gender, race, and ethnicity) must be managed to support unique patient identification, reporting, care provision requirements. Patient Demographic information may also include information about the patient's contacts, methods of contact (e.g., email or telephone), and modes of contact (e.g., call secretary during the day, send text message on the weekend). Patient demographic data are captured and maintained as discrete fields and may be enumerated, numeric, or codified according to scope of practice, organizational policy, and/or jurisdictional law. Key patient identifiers (i.e., name and primary patient record identifier) often appear on patient information output (e.g., rendering of a patient's record). Patients may have multiple, and/or compound names, sometimes employing accent marks or special characters. To help parse patient names, discete fields are often used."
CPS.1.3,,Capture Quick Registration,Capture Quick Registration,,EhrSfmCaptureQuickRegistration,EhrSfmRecordManagement,"Capture a registration, either directly entered or received from an external system, without complete supporting demographics, in order to facilitate patient care before the full registration is complete.","The registration process, including the verification of full demographics data, insurance, contact information, etc. is frequently time consuming. To facilitate patient care in emergency situations, the system must be able to register a patient with minimal information in a time critical manner. Examples of situations when this might be necessary include when a patient presents with acute myocardial infarction, a disaster response, or a mass casualty event.After care is given during an emergent situation, records are often incomplete or invalid. Such records may need to be completed and validated. Afterwards, those records may need to be harmonized. For example, the records of ""John Doe1; approximate age is 30"" may need to be matched with existing records for ""Henry Smith; age 28""."
CPS.1.4,,Capture Referral Request,Capture Referral Request,,EhrSfmCaptureReferralRequest,EhrSfmRecordManagement,"Enable the receipt and processing of referrals from care providers or healthcare organizations, including clinical and administrative details of the referral, and consents and authorizations for disclosures as required.","Incoming referrals may be from physicians' offices, specialists, clinics, Emergency Medical Services (EMS), transfers from other hospitals or emergency departments, nursing homes, etc. Referrals may be received electronically (i.e. e-Referrals); or may be received non-electronically. If non-electronic, the system needs to allow the user to capture the referral information and manage referral request. If the system supports e-Referrals, then the system will also need to support additional functionality to manage the receipt of the referral request. When a system receives a referral request the request must be validated against established criteria to determine if it meets the recipient’s requirements and is appropriate. Referrals may be received for patients who do not previously exist in the recipient system and the system must allow for the ability to triage the request and respond to the requestor. If appropriate the system should allow for the creation of a patient record including the capture of clinical and administrative information received with the referral request. The management of information on patients who are inbound to the care setting is an important component of information management. Data must be easily accessible, centrally retrievable, updatable, transportable and reusable. Clinical data from provider to provider is essential to quality-coordinated care for patients referred to the care setting. Knowledge of patients who are expected to arrive helps both care setting and administrative staff plan resource use in real time."
CPS.1.5,,Manage Patient Encounter,Manage Patient Encounter,,EhrSfmManagePatientEncounter,EhrSfmRecordManagement,"Manage patient encounter information, including tele-health encounters, and support follow-up encounters.","Each encounter of the patient with the healthcare setting needs to be recorded and the information relevant to the distinct encounter managed. This information includes date and time of the encounter, providers involved, location(s), and the reason for the encounter etc. Additionally, follow-up encounters may require prior administrative and clinical information to be determined or captured, maintained and rendered.Tele-health encounters have unique requirements that may also be supported by the system."

Some forms of inter-practitioner communication will be paper based and the EHR-S must be able to produce appropriate documents.The system should provide for both verbal and written communication. These exchanges would include but not be limited to consults, and referrals as well as possible exchanges within the office as part of the provision and administration of patient care (e.g., the communication of new information obtained within the office environment during the process of administration of a tetanus shot while the patient is in the exam room)."

AS.5,Manage Clinical Workflow Tasking,,Manage Clinical Workflow Tasking,,EhrSfmManageClinicalWorkflowTasking,EhrSfmAdministrationSupport,"Create, schedule, update and manage tasks with appropriate timeliness.","Since an electronic health record will replace the paper chart or other paper-based system, tasks that were based on the paper artifact must be effectively managed in the electronic environment. Functions must exist in the EHR-S that support electronically any workflow that previously depended on the existence of a physical artifact (such as the paper chart, a phone message slip) in a paper based system. Tasks differ from other more generic communication among participants in the care process because they are a call to action and target completion of a specific workflow in the context of a patient's health record (including a specific component of the record). Tasks also require disposition (final resolution). The initiator may optionally require a response. For example, in a paper based system, physically placing charts in piles for review creates a physical queue of tasks related to those charts. This queue of tasks (for example, a set of patient phone calls to be returned) must be supported electronically so that the list (of patients to be called) is visible to the appropriate user or role for disposition. The state transition (e.g., created, performed and resolved) may be managed by the user explicitly or automatically based on rules. For example, if a user has a task to signoff on a test result, that task should automatically be marked complete by the EHR when the test result linked to the task is signed in the system. Patients will become more involved in the care process by receiving tasks related to their care."
AS.5.1,,"Clinical Task Creation, Assignment and Routing","Clinical Task Creation, Assignment and Routing",,EhrSfmClinicalTaskCreationAssignmentAndRouting,EhrSfmManageClinicalWorkflowTasking,"Creation, assignment, delegation, and/or transmission of tasks to the appropriate parties.","A ""Task"" is a specific piece of work or duty that is assigned to a person or entity. A task often needs to be accomplished within a defined period of time or by a deadline. Tasks are often managed by an activity (or project) tracking mechanism (e.g., as part of an automated business rule process). Tasks are determined by the specific needs of patients and practitioners in a care setting. Task creation may be automated, where appropriate. An example of a system-triggered task is when laboratory results are received electronically; a task to review the result is automatically generated and assigned to a responsible party. Tasks are at all times assigned to at least one user or role for disposition. Whether the task is assignable and to whom the task can be assigned will be determined by the specific needs of practitioners in a care setting. Task-assignment lists help users prioritize and complete assigned tasks. For example, after receiving communication (e.g., a phone call or e-mail) from a patient, the triage nurse routes or assigns a task to return the patient's call to the physician who is on call physician. Another example is for a urinalysis, the nurse routes or assigns a task to clinical staff to collect a urine specimen, and for the results to be routed to the responsible physician and person ordering the test. Task creation and assignment may be automated, where appropriate. An example is when (International Normalized Ratio) INR results are received they should be automatically routed and assigned to the staff person in the clinic responsible for managing all of the patients that are having INR tests done. Task assignment ensures that all tasks are disposed of by the appropriate person or role and allows efficient interaction of entities in the care process. When a task is assigned to more than one individual or role, an indication is required to show whether the task must be completed by all individuals/roles or if only one completion suffice."

An example of a system-triggered task is when a medication defined as for continuous use runs out, a notification task should be initiated for evaluation of the need to renew or not. Quality care implies consideration of medication continuation or renewal in light of various patient and visit factors . This requires also that the relevant information is presented to the clinician in an effective manner. The decision by the clinician must then be captured in an efficient manner and actioned by the system through task assignment and communication. Presentation of tasks to be carried out needs to be in a manner that facilitates their execution and management and needs to correspond to user preferences. For example, the list could be ordered by priority or by pharmacy phone number for efficiency."
AS.5.3,,Clinical Task Linking,Clinical Task Linking,,EhrSfmClinicalTaskLinking,EhrSfmManageClinicalWorkflowTasking,"Linkage of tasks to EHR components, patients, and/or a relevant part of the electronic health  record.","Clinical tasks must include information or provide an electronic link to information that is required to complete the task. There is a need to create the appropriate links and, then, to have the system automatically present the information that was linked. For example, this may include a patient location in a facility, a patient’s, and/or family's contact information, or a link to new laboratory results in the patient’s EHR. Other example: the linkage of prescription task to the appropriate patient care plan to facilitate follow-up actions; a task to take weights links to the ‘Weights and Vitals’ screen to record the result; a task to complete a fall assessment links to the fall assessment form to be completed. An example of a well defined task is ""Dr. Jones must review Mr. Smith's blood work results.""

The timeliness of certain tasks can be tracked, or reports generated, in accordance with relevant law and accreditation standards. For example, a provider is able to create a report that shows tests that have not yet been performed such as urine specimen obtained, blood work drawn, etc. Another example is that of an electronic prescribing system that would track when a refill request or prescription change is received, who it has been assigned to, the action performed, and when it was completed."

For example, cohorts can be described in terms of demographics; education and social status; health status, diseases, or outcomes; industry and occupation; or injuries. Population health analysts, such as experts in public health departments, may compile individual, and/or population information reported or otherwise gathered from multiple EHRs within the jurisdictional area for surveillance and research. Populations of one or none also can be informative. By analyzing specified data for a cohort, public health experts and care providers can monitor disease prevalence and health-related trends; evaluate behavioral, socio economical, occupational, and other impacts on health; and identify potential outbreaks and associated risk factors. Examples include:-examining a cohort of patients with measles for a common (implied) exposure, such as attending the same school - following a cohort of diabetics with out-of-range markers, or analyze them from various perspectives, such as by occupation, blood sugar range, drugs that are being used and not being used. - examining a cohort of bakers for a higher-than-expected prevalence of asthma. - Upon suspicion of a flu outbreak, reviewing a cohort of patients who have presented in the Emergency Department in the last three days complaining of breathing difficulty. - Examining cohorts of smokers with lung disease, sand-blasters with breathing disorders, adults with asthma, etc. A broad range of information is used for population health surveillance and analyses, including (but not limited to) health teatus/disease/outcomes, completion/results of recommended health screens, current or previous medical treatment data, demographics, education, marital status, social factors, family history of diseases, personal history (e.g., alcohol and tobacco use, reading capability, hearing deficiency), and environmental factors (such as occupation and industry, shift-work, hobby). The information may or may not be coded; the text may be structured or unstructured. Person-level data is used to identify persons with specified characteristics such as exposures, symptoms, risk factors, injuries, genetic markers, diseases or health outcomes that may require further care. Person-level data also is required to evaluate groupings of injuries, diseases or adverse health outcomes. Issues of access to person-level data while securing patient privacy are relevant. Data also may be monitored and analyzed in “aggregate” (for example, by age range, geographic location, socio-economic level, or education level), depicting the quantity of records, and/or content within each aggregate. Aggregates may be used to report deidentified data to public health, for example, cases of influenza-like-illness by age range.Case and population information are subject to public health reporting. Care organizations may require population health reports, for example, to measure quality of care based on health improvements for populations under the care of their providers. Statistical analyses are a key component to analyzing population health data, such as epidemiological investigations to identify relationships between risks (such as exposures or behaviors) and health conditions. Individual clinicians or healthcare organizations may employ limited capabilities in EHR systems to analyze population health data. The EHR system also should be capable of interacting with, and leveraging, the capabilities of specialized external analytical systems.The investigator may hide or mask certain aspects of epidemiological investigation information, as necessary according to scope of practice, policy, and/or law. The investigator may desire to tag or remove patients from the cohort who have relocated or died."

Preparing such well-defined queries, i.e., selection criteria and parameters, used to generate a cohort can be a complex and iterative process. The investigator may desire to use pre-defined or self-constructed queries (which may be saved for reuse). During the process of defining a query, the investigator may desire to accumulate statistics regarding the results of interim queries (e.g., number of patients in the query result) to determine the suitability of the queries, and subsequently modify the final query. The investigator maintains sets of queries by constructing names that depict the cohorts, the fields comprising the queries and, perhaps, values for those fields. The resultant data set generated should be validated against the intended purpose of the query. Queries may need to be saved to support future analysis of the same (or a similar) cohort. For example, the investigator may construct an ""Insulin study for males age 65 and older"" query that is used to review patients of a specific age, gender and drug usage, then also construct an “Insulin study for females age 65 and older” query by modifying a copy of the first one. Queries may identify “static” or “dynamic” cohorts. A “static cohort” query identifies and monitors certain patients within a given cohort over time (e.g., pregnant patients who arrived in the Emergency Department in January, 2012 and followed throughout their pregnancies). A “dynamic cohort” query may identify new patients to be added periodically to a cohort (e.g., the number of pregnant patients who arrived in the Emergency Department during each month). Information compiled by using a query may need to be governed by applicable policies and regulations. For example, psychiatric data may need to be excluded from a given epidemiological investigation. The query may need to specify that subjects are de-identified or aggregates are created according to the requirements of the analysis or privacy restrictions. For example, queries may be made of de-identified aggregate subjects to evaluate possible medical products safety issues quickly and securely. Data aggregation may be used to de-identify subjects, to condense the cohort, or to sub-divide a given cohort into various ""aggregates"" (for example, by age range, geographic location, socio-economic level, or education level), depicting the quantity of records, and/or content within each aggregate. Aggregate data may need to be integrated or linked d within or across cohorts. The criteria for data aggregation also may be applied to different cohorts."

Healthcare can be improved if analyses are performed on a population basis to evaluate care delivery, health status and disease trends, and identify potential modifiable risk factors. The various ways of analyzing a population (cohort) can be complex. Some population-based research examines relationships between events or exposures and their corresponding outcomes. Other population based research may focus on healthcare utilization, service availability and quality of care. Population-level surveillance, monitoring of disease, and epidemiologic research involves analysis of data based on existing relationships between pre-defined and well-known data elements. These analyses utilize various data elements including demographics, education, marital status, social factors, family history of diseases, personal history (e.g., alcohol and tobacco use, reading capability, hearing impairment), environmental factors (such as proximity to toxic exposures), occupational factors (such as type of occupation and industry, shift-work, training, hobby), genomic and proteomic data elements, resource utilization, problem lists, and other clinical information. The identification of new and previously unrecognized patterns of disease may require sophisticated pattern recognition analysis. Early recognition of new patterns may require data available early in the disease presentation. For example, an investigation of pneumococcal disease may involve a trend analysis of the causative serotype (laboratory data) over time, evaluated per age group of patients diagnosed with pneumonia (aggregates). Several aggregates may be identified (e.g., multiple age groups). Each aggregate then is analyzed as a group for selected data pattern(s) using data elements that include, but are not limited to, patient demographics, presenting symptoms, acute treatment regimens, occupational information, and laboratory and imaging study orders and results."

The cohort and aggregate data (query results) may need to be shared within a facility or transmitted to other organizations on an ad hoc or periodic (namely, regularly scheduled) basis. For example, public health surveillance, monitoring and research often rely on analysis of data from multiple sources, including EHR systems. The data may need to be prepared in user-defined formats or formats defined by external parties. The care provider, public health expert, or organization may need to transmit individual or aggregate data in multiple formats (e.g., to an external statistical analytic application or to public health agencies to meet reporting requirements). Query results may need to be viewed, saved, and/or printed in pre-defined or ad hoc report formats, ( e.g., for quality reporting within the care organization).

RI.1,Record Lifecycle and Lifespan,,Record Lifecycle and Lifespan,,EhrSfmRecordLifecycleAndLifespan,EhrSfmRecordInfrastructure,Manage Record Lifecycle and Lifespan,"Actions are taken to support patient health. Actions are taken in provision of healthcare to individuals. Actions are taken as the result of rules-based EHR System algorithms. Actors (i.e., patients, providers, users, systems) take Actions. (Actions broadly encompass tasks, acts, procedures or services performed or provided.) The EHR System captures Actions taken and creates corresponding Record Entries. Record Entries provide persistent evidence of Action occurrence, context, disposition, facts, findings and observations. From the point of Record Entry origination to the end of its lifespan, the EHR System manages each Entry consistent with and according to scope of practice, organizational policy, and jurisdictional law. In support of individual health and in provision of healthcare to individuals, Actors perform Actions and Actions have corresponding Entries in the EHR Record, (i.e., Action instances are documented by Record Entry instances). Record Entries may be captured during the course of the Action or sometime thereafter. The Actor (author/source) of the Record Entry may be the same as an Actor performing the Action or not. The EHRS Functional Model does not specify a particular relationship of Actions and corresponding Record Entries. It may be one to one, many to one or even one to many. Actions have associated metadata (e.g., who, what, when, where, why, how, under what conditions, in what context). The corresponding Record Entry captures this metadata along with other Action and Record Entry related information. Each Record Entry also includes its own provenance metadata such as who (authoring Actor) and when (documented). Record Entries may be encapsulated to bind Actor (individual, organization, and/or system) signatures to data and metadata content and data/time of occurrence. Actions and related Record Entries capture a chronology of patient health and healthcare and also a chronology of operations and services provided in/by a healthcare enterprise. Record Entries reflect changes in health information from the time it was created, to the time it was amended, sent, received, etc. In this manner, each Record Entry serves as persistent evidence of an Action taken, enabling providers to maintain comprehensive information that may be needed for legal, business, and disclosure purposes. To satisfy these purposes, Record Entries must also be retained and persisted without alteration. Record Entries have both a lifecycle and a lifespan. Lifecycle Events include originate, retain, amend, verify, attest, access/view, de-identify, transmit/receive, and more. Lifecycle Events occur at various points in a Record Entry lifespan, always starting with a point of origination and retention (i.e., when the Entry is first created and stored). A Record Entry may have a pre and post Event state if content is modified. In this case, the original Record Entry is preserved (with signature binding) and a new Entry is created (with new signature binding). A Record Entry contains data and metadata, in multiple formats, following various conventions and standards. Included data may be tagged, and/or delimited, structured (concise, encoded, computable), or unstructured (free form, non-computable). Data may be encoded as text, document, images, audio, waveforms, in ASCII, binary or other encoding. Structured data may be characterized as being concise, encoded, computable, and may be divided into discrete fields. Examples of structured health information include: - patient residence (non-codified, but discrete field) - diastolic blood pressure (numeric) - coded laboratory result or observation - coded diagnosis - patient risk assessment questionnaire with multiple-choice answers. Unstructured data may be characterized as being free form, and/or non-computable. Unstructured health record information is information that is not divided into discrete fields AND not represented as numeric, enumerated or codified data. Examples of unstructured health record information include: - text (text message to physician) - word processing document (a letter from a family member) - image (photograph of a patient or a scanned image of insurance card) - multimedia (dictated report or a voice recording). Context may determine whether data are structured or unstructured. For example, a progress note might be standardized and structured in some systems (e.g., Subjective/Objective/Assessment/Plan) but unstructured in other systems. The EHR System manages Record Lifecycle Events for each Record Entry, including pre and post Event record states, continuity, persistence and related Record Audit Logs."

Once a Record Entry has been retracted, it is no longer visible in standard queries, though it remains accessible in EHR audit records should evidence ever be required for legal or other exceptional circumstances.Canada Health Infoway provides the following definition for retraction: This mechanism allows an existing record to be “removed” from the EHR if it is deemed erroneous. It can also be used to reverse changes that have been made to an existing record. Once a record has been retracted, it is no longer visible in standard queries, though it remains accessible in EHR audit records should evidence ever be required for legal or other exceptional circumstances. After retracting an erroneous record, a user has the ability to resubmit a corrected record with no visible indication that there was ever a previous version. Retract generally has significant constraints upon its use because of the risks of removing data from a patient’s record that might have been used by others in making decisions. The specifics will vary by jurisdiction, and potentially even by type of data.There are times that a EHR Record Entry is created then found to be erroneous, i.e., the record may belong to another individual. In these cases, it is necessary to remove that record from view (storing it in case it may be needed for litigation or investigation purposes, etc.).

Therefore it is important that, through various interoperability mechanisms, an EHR-S maintains all the relevant information regarding the health record in synchrony. For example, if a physician orders an MRI, a set of diagnostic images and a radiology report will be created. As a result, the patient demographic information, the order for MRI, the diagnostic images associated with the order, and the report associated with the study must all be synchronized in order for the clinicians to receive a synchronized view the complete record (with respect to time and geographic location).Date and time need to be consistent across the applications that are part of the EHR system.Synchronization demonstrates a sequence and chain of events for reconstruction and is relevant during a legal proceeding.

RI.3,,Record Archive and Restore,Record Archive and Restore,,EhrSfmRecordArchiveAndRestore,EhrSfmRecordInfrastructure,Manage Record Archive and Restore,"EHR Record Entries must be transitioned over its lifecycle from online data structures to near-line or off-line data structures. The archive function performs this transition of Record Entries from an online, production EHR-S to offline storage for information that is not being purged/destroyed. The system must provide such archive and restore functions to extract and preserve indefinitely, Record Entries selected to be removed from the live production EHR-S database and retained.Record Entries must be archived and restored in such a manner as to permit them to be returned to their original or similar information structures. Archived Record Entries must also include corresponding metadata to ensure logical and semantic consistency of the information for subsequent access upon restoration.The archive function should provide both an automated, configurable capability as well as a user-invoked archival function to enable selected Record Entries to be preserved, or flagged for preservation. In the first instance, rules are specified to enable the system to conduct archiving in an unattended fashion. This is often the case for periodic system maintenance requirements (e.g., nightly processing where archival, data summarization and possibly purging of information occurs). In the second instance the system should provide the ability to select Record Entries to be preserved for future reference and access, such as in the case where selected Entries need to be preserved and retained for litigation.In restoring information, it may occur that Record Entries being restored are a subset of the Entries originally archived. For example, when all Record Entries for a patient encounter were archived and only a particular set of Record Entries related to a study or result are to be restored. The system may provide for such finer granularity of restoration.Archiving and restoring of Record Entries must be performed in a timely fashion, consistent with the operational requirements of both EHR users and system and technology capabilities.The system must enable compliance with records retention according to scope of practice, organizational policy or jurisdictional law."

TI.1.2,,Entity Authorization,Entity Authorization,,EhrSfmEntityAuthorization,EhrSfmSecurity,Manage set(s) of EHR-S access control permissions.,"Entities are authorized to use components of an EHR-S in accordance with their scope of practice within local policy or legal jurisdiction. Authorization rules provide a proper framework for establishing access permissions and privileges for the use of an EHR system, based on user, role or context. A combination of these authorization categories may be applied to control access to EHRS resources (i.e., functions or data), including at the operating system level.- User based authorization refers to the permissions granted to access EHR-S resources based on the identity of an entity (e.g., user or software component). - Role based authorization refers to the permissions granted to access EHR-S resources based on the role of an entity. Examples of roles include: an application or device (tele-monitor or robotic); or a nurse, dietician, administrator, legal guardian, and auditor. - Context-based Authorization refers to the permissions granted to access EHR-S resources within a context, such as when a request occurs, explicit time, location, route of access, quality of authentication, work assignment, patient consents and authorization. See ISO 10181-3 Technical Framework for Access Control Standard. For example, an EHR-S might only allow supervising providers’ context authorization to attest to entries proposed by residents under their supervision."

Non-repudiation is a way to guarantee that the source of the data/record cannot later deny that fact; and that the sender of a message cannot later deny having sent the message; and that the recipient cannot deny having received the message. Components of non-repudiation can include: - Digital signature, which serves as a unique identifier for an individual (much like a written signature); -Confirmation service, which utilizes a message transfer agent to create a digital receipt (providing confirmation that a message was sent, and/or received); - Timestamp, which proves that a document existed at a certain date and time; - The use of standardized timekeeping protocols (e.g., the Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) Consistent Time Profile)."
TI.1.6,,Secure Data Exchange,Secure Data Exchange,,EhrSfmSecureDataExchange,EhrSfmSecurity,Secure all modes of EHR data exchange.,"Whenever an exchange of EHR information occurs, it requires appropriate security and privacy considerations, including data obfuscation as well as both destination and source authentication when necessary.

TI.1.7,,Secure Data Routing,Secure Data Routing,,EhrSfmSecureDataRouting,EhrSfmSecurity,Route electronically exchanged EHR data only to/from known and authenticated destinations/sources  (according to applicable healthcare-specific rules and relevant standards).,"An EHR-S needs to ensure that it is exchanging EHR information with the entities (applications, institutions, directories) it expects. This function depends on entity authorization and authentication to be available in the system. For example, a physician practice management application in an EHR-S might send claim attachment information to an external entity. To accomplish this, the application must use a secure routing method, which ensures that both the sender and receiving sides are authorized to engage in the information exchange. Known sources and destinations can be established in a static setup or they can be dynamically determined. Examples of a static setup are recordings of IP addresses or recordings of DNS names. For dynamic determination of known sources and destinations systems can use authentication mechanisms as described in IN.1.For example, the sending of a laboratory order from the EHRS to a laboratory system within the same organization usually uses a simple static setup for routing. In contrast sending a laboratory order to a reference laboratory outside of the organization will involve some kind of authentication process. Provision of a secure network infrastructure is beyond the scope of an EHR-S."

Violations or potential violations can impose tangible economic or social losses on affected patients, as well as less tangible feelings of vulnerability and pain. Fear of potential violations discourages patients from revealing sensitive personal information that may be relevant to diagnostic and treatment services. Rules for the protection of privacy and confidentiality may vary depending upon the vulnerability of patients and the sensitivity of records. Strongest protections should apply to the records of minors and the records of patients with stigmatized conditions. Authorization to access the most sensitive parts of an EHR is most definitive if made by the explicit and specific consent of the patient.

TI.1.9,,System Operation Measurements,System Operation Measurements,,EhrSfmSystemOperationMeasurements,EhrSfmSecurity,Manage the change of status of an external facility.,"A health care delivery relies on services provided by other external facilities such as laboratories or Long Term Care facilities. The status of those facilities is subject to change for example: power outage, flooding or overcapacity. Therefore, the EHR system needs to capture the status of the external facilities, notify appropriate individuals / organizations or even change the workflow based on established business rules. Change of the status of an external facility is patient safety concern because a provider may need to adjust patient care or care workflows accordingly. For example, changes of status of external facility include: laboratory no longer accredited, laboratory power outage, Long Term Care facility at overcapacity. If laboratory loses accreditation an administrator needs to be notified to adjust the workflow. If status change is anticipated on regular basis, the system may automatically trigger workflow adjustment according to established business rule that take in consideration the status of the external facility. The example for later, the local Long Term Care facility may routinely exceed the capacity on the weekends; therefore, the business rule will accommodate for automatic workflow adjustments."

These services enable the linking of relevant information across multiple information sources within, or external to, an EHR-S for use within an application. This applies to directories/registries internal to the EHR-S as well as directories/registries external to the EHR-S . Transmission may occur automatically or manually and may include small or large amounts of data. Directories and registries support communication between EHR Systems and may be organized hierarchically or in a federated fashion. For example, a patient being treated by a primary care physician for a chronic condition may become ill while out of town. The new provider’s EHR-S interrogates a local, regional, or national registry to find the patient’s previous records. From the primary care record, a remote EHR-S retrieves relevant information in conformance with applicable patient privacy and confidentiality rules.An example of local registry usage is an EHR-S application sending a query message to the Hospital Information System to retrieve a patient’s demographic data."

Interoperability is demonstrated by the consistency of human and machine interpretation of shared data and reports. It includes the capture and support of consistent data for templates and decision support logic.Terminology standards pertain to concepts, representations, synonyms, relationships and computable (machine-readable) definitions. Terminology services provide a common way for managing and retrieving these items, including historically correct version interpretation. Terminology services need to support legal requirements for retrospective health record information and system data."

An example of an information model is the HL7 Reference Information Model. Another example is the ISO/EN 13606 Electronic Health Record Communication.A terminology provides semantic and computable identity to its concepts. Examples of terminologies that an EHR-S may support include: LOINC, SNOMED, ICD-9, ICD-10, and CPT-4.Terminologies are use-case dependent and may or may not be realm dependent. The key is that the standard be approved by all stakeholders. For example, terminologies for public health interoperability may differ from those for healthcare quality, administrative reporting, research, etc.Formal standard terminology models enable common semantic representations by describing relationships that exist between concepts within a terminology or in different terminologies, such as exemplified in the model descriptions contained in the HL7 Common Terminology Services specification.The clinical use of standard terminologies is greatly enhanced with the ability to perform hierarchical inference searches across coded concepts. Hierarchical Inference enables searches to be conducted across sets of coded concepts stored in an EHR-S. Relationships between concepts in the terminology are used in the search to recognize child concepts of a common parent. For example, there may be a parent concept, ""penicillin containing preparations"" which has numerous child concepts, each of which represents a preparation containing a specific form of penicillin (Penicillin V, Penicillin G, etc.). Therefore, a search may be conducted to find all patients taking any form of penicillin preparation.Clinical and other terminologies may be provided through a terminology service internal or external to an EHR-S."

Such changes need to be cascaded to clinical content embedded in templates,  custom formularies, etc., as determined by existing policy.","Version control allows for multiple sets or versions of the same terminology to exist and be distinctly recognized over time. Standard terminologies are usually periodically updated, and concurrent use of different versions may be required. Ideally, the meaning of a concept never changes over time, but a concept can be deprecated, and replaced with a new concept in a new version. However, in some terminologies, the meaning of a concept can change over time. In any case, it is important that retrospective analysis and research maintains the ability to relate to the appropriate conceptual meaning. If the terminology encoding for a concept changes over time, it is also important that for legal health records, as well as for retrospective analysis and research, the different encodings can be correlated to ensure the permanence of the concept as originally captured. This does not necessarily imply that complete older versions of the terminology be kept in the EHR-S, only access to the changes needs to be maintained."
TI.4.3,,Terminology Mapping,Terminology Mapping,,EhrSfmTerminologyMapping,EhrSfmStandardTerminologyAndTerminologyServices,"Map or translate one terminology to another as needed by local, regional, national, or international  interoperability requirements.","The ability to map or translate one terminology to another is fundamental to an organization in an environment where several terminologies are in play to meet different purposes. It is a common occurrence that data is captured using one terminology, but is shared using another terminology.Example: Within a healthcare organization there may be a need to map terminology concepts with the same semantic meaning to meet different purposes (e.g., between an EHRS and an external laboratory system, or between an EHRS and a billing system). Standard terminologies are evolving and maps will need to be adjusted to support this evolution and more sophisticated use of standard terminologies and maps over time.Realm specific (including local, regional, national or international) interoperability requirements can also determine the need for terminology mapping, and in many cases terminology mapping services (internal or external) can be used to satisfy these requirements.The interaction and mapping of terminologies may be called into question in a legal proceeding, when clinical decisions were documented or when semantic meaning could be misinterpreted. It is important to seek guidance, document and retain all mapping decisions for all types of terminology mapping, and to recognize when mapping may not be possible from one concept to another. The quality of mapping is dependent upon the skills and interpretation of standard terminologies and clinical information by mapping experts."

Interoperability standards also enable certain information to be shared among EHR systems (including information that resides in regional, national, or international information exchanges). Interoperability standards also promote timely and efficient information capture, use, and re-use, often reducing the cumulative workload of the broad set of stakeholders.When health-related information is exchanged -- or when external applications are used to extend an EHR system -- the interoperability methods and underlying standards that were used in the process may need to be disclosed during a legal proceeding (especially when the resulting information becomes part of the patient's medical record)."

These systems include other EHR systems, subcomponents of an EHR system, or other (authorized, non-EHR) systems.","Since a health care organization typically has various external and internal interoperability requirements, it must use a set of corresponding interoperability or interchange standards that will meet its connectivity and information structure, format, and semantic requirements. Information should be exchanged -- and applications should provide functionality -- in a manner that appears to be seamless to the user. To be specific, if data is received from an external source that requires a user to manually copy-and-paste that data into multiple parts of the system, the exchange is not considered to be ""seamless"". Examples of standards-based EHR information content and exchange methods include: standards-based data extracts, standards-based messages, standards-based documents (e.g., HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) documents), standards-based healthcare transactions, and standards-based images (e.g., Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) documents). Support for multiple interaction modes is needed to respond to differing levels of immediacy and types of exchange. For example, messaging is effective for many near-real time, asynchronous data exchange scenarios but may not be appropriate if the end-user is requesting an immediate response from a remote application. A variety of interaction modes are typically supported such as: - Unsolicited Notifications (e.g., Adam Everyman has arrived at the clinic for his scheduled appointment); - Query/Response (e.g., Query: Is Adam Everyman known to the system? Response: Yes, Adam's medical record number is 12345678); - Service Request and Response (e.g., Request: Laboratory Order for “Fasting Blood Sugar”. Response: the results of the test); - Information Interchange between organizations (e.g., in a regional health exchange or in a national health system); - Structured/discrete clinical documents (e.g., a structured clinical note); - Unstructured clinical document (e.g., dictated surgical note). Standard terminology is a fundamental part of interoperability and is described in section TI.4. Using a formal explicit information model further optimizes interoperability. An example of an information model is the HL7 Reference Information Model (RIM). Organizations typically need to deal with more than one information model and may need to develop a mapping between information models, a metamodel (that helps to explain and organize the various information models), or both."

TI.5.2,,Interchange Standards Versioning and Maintenance,Interchange Standards Versioning and Maintenance,,EhrSfmInterchangeStandardsVersioningAndMaintenance,EhrSfmStandardsbasedInteroperability,Support various versions of an interchange standard.,"Interchange standards characteristically change throughout their lifecycles; those changes are often tagged with ""version"" numbers. EHR systems need to control the various versions of interchange standards that are used within an EHR implementation and accommodate changes that arise with each version.For example, if an organization migrates to version 2.5 of HL7's messaging standard, it may choose to utilize that version's specimen or blood bank information capabilities. The organization may also find that certain fields have been retained for backwards compatibility only or withdrawn altogether. The EHR-S needs to be able to handle all of these possibilities.Standards typically evolve in such a way as to protect backwards compatibility. On the other hand, sometimes there is little, or no, backwards compatibility when an organization may need to replace an entire standard with a new methodology. An example of this is migrating from HL7 v2 to HL7 v3.Interchange standards that are backward compatible support exchange among senders and receivers who are using different versions. Version control ensures that those sending information in a later version of a standard consider the difference in information content that can be interchanged effectively with receivers, who are capable of processing only earlier versions. That is, senders need to be aware of the information that receivers are unable to capture and adjust their business processes accordingly. Version control enables multiple versions of the same interchange standard to exist and be distinctly recognized over time. Since interchange standards are usually periodically updated, concurrent use of different versions may be required.Large (and/or federated) organizations typically need to use different versions of an interchange standard to meet internal organizational interoperability requirements.For example, the enterprise-wide standard might use HL7 v2.5 for laboratory messages, but some regions of the enterprise might be at a lower level.It should be possible to retire deprecated interchange standards versions when applicable business cycles are completed while maintaining obsolete versions. An example use of this is for possible claims adjustment throughout the claim’s life cycle.When interchange standards change over time, it is important that retrospective analysis and research correlate and note gaps between the different versions’ information structures to support the permanence of concepts over time."

An EHR-S can use this information to define how data will be exchanged between the sending and the receiving partners. Interchange services and capabilities can be discovered in an automated fashion.Entity directories can be used to determine the address, profile, and data exchange requirements of known, and/or potential Interchange Agreement partners.

Conversely, an EHR system may access these other systems indirectly by integrating with a system that serves as the central routing mechanism for the organization. For example, the EHR system may be integrated with the Hospital Information System which then routes the EHR system's orders to a laboratory , pharmacy, or radiology service.

The backup must preserve both data as well as database structure and definition information sufficient to recover a complete functional EHR system. Database components may include, but not be limited to application data, security credentials, log/audit files, and programs; ultimately all EHR components necessary to provide a full and complete operating environment. Finally, the backup must be capable of being used during recovery processing to restore an exact copy of the EHR system as of a particular instant in time.

TI.9,,System Management Operations and Performance,System Management Operations and Performance,,EhrSfmSystemManagementOperationsAndPerformance,EhrSfmTrustInfrastructure,"Manage the change of status of an external facility and the ability to access, render and determine information related to Service Level Agreement.","A health care delivery relies on services provided by other external facilities such as laboratories or Long Term Care facilities. The status of those facilities is subject to change for example: power outage, flooding or overcapacity. Therefore, the EHR system needs to capture the status of the external facilities, notify appropriate individuals / organizations or even change the workflow based on established business rules. Change of the status of an external facility is patient safety concern because a provider may need to adjust patient care or care workflows accordingly. For example, changes of status of external facility include: laboratory no longer accredited, laboratory power outage, Long Term Care facility at overcapacity. If laboratory loses accreditation an administrator needs to be notified to adjust the workflow. If status change is anticipated on regular basis, the system may automatically trigger workflow adjustment according to established business rules that take into consideration the status of the external facility. The example for later, the local Long Term Care facility may routinely exceed the capacity on the weekends; therefore, the business rule will accommodate for automatic workflow adjustments. A provider may need to be aware of certain Service Level Agreement information in order to mitigate patient safety-related risks that depend on system availability or system performance."
